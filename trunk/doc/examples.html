<H1>PLIB: Example Programs and Demonstrations.</H1>

PLIB has three sources of sample programs to learn from.
<ul>
<li> EXAMPLES: There is a bundle of small programs that each show
     off one or two small aspects of PLIB and which are
     not generally all that useful by themselves.
<li> DEMOS: These are fully worked out demonstration programs
     that use a wide range of PLIB features to create complete
     and useful programs that are still small enough to understand
     quite easily.
<li> APPLICATIONS: Because many PLIB applications are OpenSourced,
     there are a large number of complex programs that you can
     look at to see how large games, simulations and interactive
     tools can be built using this technology.
</ul>

<H2> EXAMPLES </H2>

The PLIB example programs are distributed in <A HREF="download.html#EXAMPLES">
a separate tarball</A> from the main PLIB distribution - and generally, it
is updated less often - but following the same version numbers as the
main PLIB library.
<p>
When you install that package, you'll see that the 'src' directory is
split into sections for each PLIB component library - with one or two
different examples for each library.
<p>
All of the examples are licensed under GPL as bundle and are maintained
under the PLIB CVS archive.
<ul>
<li>FNT:<ul>
        <li> fnt_test - a basic TXF font browser.
        <li> slideshow - a way to present a simple slide-show driven
                      from an ASCII text file. Who needs PowerPoint
                      when you have 'vi'? :-)
        <li> data - this directory contains 20 different TXF fonts.
        </ul>
<li>JS:<ul>
       <li> js_demo - a program that shows the current output from
                      whatever joysticks it can detect. Useful for
                      testing out which buttons set which bits and
                      which axes are which.
       </ul>
<li>NET:<ul>
       No Demo programs have been written for NET yet.
       </ul>
<li>PUI:<ul>
       <li> simple - the "Hello World" of PUI programs.
       <li> complex - a fairly pointless program that shows how
                     to control a spinning OpenGL cube, and use
                     a variety of PUI widgets.
       <li> widget_list - draws every kind of PUI widget each
                     in a separate window.  This is what we used
                     to make the screenshots for the PUI manual.
       </ul>
<li>SG:<ul>
       <li> sg_quat_test - tests the SG quaternions...unsuccessfully
                      I think!
       </ul>
<li>SL:<ul>
       <li> example - plays a number of annoying sounds.
       <li> mod_demo - plays a MOD format music file.
       </ul>
<li>SSG:<ul>
       <li> load_save - Load a 3D model - then just save it again.
       <li> majik - A test (originally written to help the Majik3D
                     project) that shows Tux walking around on some
                     auto-generated terrain.
       <li> state_test - Exercises some ssgSimpleState settings.
       <li> tux - A model of Tux the Penguin spins around on a
                    pedestal encrusted in golden Herring.
       <li> tween_test - Demonstrated the 'tween' effect.
       <li> viewer - A program to allow you to view any 3D model
                    and spin it around using the mouse.
       </ul>
<li>UTIL:<ul>
       <li> test_dir - tests some of the directory handling features.
       </ul>
</ul>
<H2> DEMONSTRATIONS </H2>

The PLIB demonstration programs are distributed in <A HREF="download.html#DEMOS">
their own separate tarballs</A> - each has it's own version number and it's
own license conditions (although all of them must fall within the SourceForge
definition for OpenSourced software in order to reside on the SourceForge
server).  All of the demonstrations are maintained under the PLIB CVS
archive.

<ul>
<li> ExPoser - A program to allow you to animate characters for your
               games using 'Skin and Bones' animation techniques.
               ExPoser needs PLIB 1.5.1 or later.
<li> TTT3D - A complete 3D TicTacToe game played on a 4x4x4 board.
               It's theoretically possible to beat it - <b>theoretically</b>.
               TTT3D needs PLIB 1.4.0 or later.
</ul>

<H2> APPLICATIONS </H2>

PLIB applications do not reside on the PLIB web site - but you can find
links to many of them in <A HREF="gallery.html">our image gallery</A>.
