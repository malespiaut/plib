<H1>SSG: A Simple Scene Graph API</H1>
<H1>for OpenGL</H1>
               by Steve Baker
</center>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
Simple Scene Graph (SSG) is intended to be a really simple,
low-impact, scene graph API that layers nicely on top
of OpenGL using C++ and which works with or without GLUT.
<p>
SSG is a part of <A HREF="../index.html">PLIB</A>.
<p>
This document assumes a certain degree of knowledge of
OpenGL.
<p>
SSG includes a subsidiary library of simple matix and vector
math with support for some intersection testing, field-of-view
culling and such like.  This is called
<A HREF="../sg/index.html">'Simple Geometry' (SG)</A>.
SG is used extensively by SSG - but is also useful as a
standalone library.
<p>
A Scene Graph is essentially just a tree-structured database
containing a hierarchy of branches - and a bunch of leaf nodes.
Each leaf node does some OpenGL rendering - the branch nodes
are intended to manage things like: field of view (FOV) culling,
level of detail (LOD) management, transformations, and animation.
<p>
In addition, each leaf node has a structure tacked on to it
to encapsulate OpenGL state information - and that in turn
may optionally have a texture applied to it.
<p>
In addition to managing the scene graph, SSG contains code
to manage the positions of cameras, lights and other rendering
aspects of OpenGL.
<H2>Symbol Conventions.</H2>
Both SSG an SG follow conventions for symbols and tokens that
are the conventions used by OpenGL and GLUT.
<p>
Hence, all SSG symbols for classes and functions start with <code>ssg</code>
and all <code>#define</code> tokens start with <code>SSG</code>.  Functions and symbols
that belong to the SG library similarly start with <code>sg</code> or <code>SG</code>.
<p>
Words within a class or function name are Capitalised and NOT
separated with underscores. Words within <code>#define</code> tokens may
be separated with underscores to make them readable.
<H2>Initialisation.</H2>
The first SSG call in any program must always be ssgInit(). Call
ssgInit only after you have obtained an OpenGL rendering context
(or called glutInit() and created a rendering window if you are
using glut).
<H2>Classes</H2>
The following class hierarchy makes up the core package - which
can be extended to add functionality or to change some underlying
mechanisms.
<pre>

   class ssgBase
    |__ class ssgSimpleList
    |    |
    |    |__ class ssgVertexArray
    |    |__ class ssgNormalArray
    |    |__ class ssgTexCoordArray
    |    |__ class ssgColourArray
    |    |__ class ssgIndexArray
    |
    |__ class ssgEntity
    |    |
    |    |__ class ssgLeaf
    |    |    |__ class ssgVTable (deprecated)
    |    |    |__ class ssgVtxTable
    |    |          |__ class ssgVtxArray
    |    |
    |    |__ class ssgBranch
    |         |__ class ssgRoot
    |         |__ class ssgInvisible
    |         |__ class ssgSelector
    |         |    |__ class ssgTimedSelector
    |         |    |__ class ssgRangeSelector
    |         |
    |         |__ class ssgBaseTransform
    |         |    |__ class ssgTransform
    |         |    |__ class ssgTexTrans
    |         |
    |         |__ class ssgCutout
    |
    |___ class ssgState
    |     |__ class ssgSimpleState
    |         |__ class ssgStateSelector
    |
    |___ class ssgTexture

</pre>
The general idea is that, all geometry is contained in ssgLeaf classes,
all data heirarchy is in a ssgBranch classes and all OpenGL state information
is in ssgStates.
<p>
You may not declare instances of ssgBase, ssgEntity, ssgBaseTransform,
ssgLeaf or ssgState since they are all abstract classes.
<p>
It is presumed that applications will add new kinds of leaves, branches,
states and textures to customise SSG to their needs.
